# lurning C++
1. Disable GitHub Copilot, use VS Code/g++ without extensions to learn the syntax
2. Learned the C++ basics like pointers, vectors, std things<br />
2.1. learned some funny things about C++
3. Implemented some algorithms/data structures like linked list, binary search tree, and a piece table (this one was really fun)
4. more thorough documentation in the comments in the code :)
