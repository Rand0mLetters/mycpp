Linked Lists are basically a chain of nodes, where each node points to the next one and the last one points to null.<br />
I really like this data structure because it can be abbreviated as "LL" and that's double my normal dose of L's.

what I learned:<br />
 - c++ generics (java is so much easier for this)<br />
 - difference between typename and class (had to use class instead of typename because of std::to_string copes)<br />
 - they *should* be defined in the header file<br />
 - but if I gotta be quirky like that, I can define them in a .tpp file and #include them at the end of a header file
